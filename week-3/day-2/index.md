#### Instructions

Given the code below, write code to make the `digitize` function work.
The function should perform the following:

* Given a non-negative integer, return an array / a list of the individual digits in order.

#### Methods to Look Up

* Number.prototype.toString()
* String.prototype.split

```js
function digitize(n) {
}

console.assert(digitize(123)[0] === 1); // Checks that the first item in an array returned by `digitize(123)` is a number 1
console.assert(digitize(8675309)[6] === 9); // Checks that the item in position 6 of an array returned by `digitize(8675309)` is a number 9
```
