## Standups

* What is going well?
* What is not going well (what are you struggling with)?
* What's something you'd like to share not about code?
* What's something you've learned

### Common Wins!

* JS HW DONE! *4x*
* Assignments
* Not TOO bad

### Common Struggles

* Catching Up!
* Javascript
* Displays
* Sleep

## Daily JS

### TDD Review

#### Instructions

Given the code below, write code to make the `digitize` function work.
The function should perform the following:

* Given a non-negative integer, return an array / a list of the individual digits in order.

#### Methods to Look Up

* Number.prototype.toString()
* String.prototype.split

```js
function digitize(n) {
}

console.assert(digitize(123)[0] === 1); // Checks that the first item in an array returned by `digitize(123)` is a number 1
console.assert(digitize(8675309)[6] === 9); // Checks that the item in position 6 of an array returned by `digitize(8675309)` is a number 9
```
