## Daily JS * 2

### Function Arguments

When looking at variables or arguments inside of functions, if they are created in the function itself just rename it `functionName_variableName` so that it is clear that these variables are DIFFERENT than variables that exist outside of that function.



```js

/* Fat arrow same as
var a = function(x = 9, y = 10) {
  return x * y;
};
 */
var x = 2;

var y = function(foo) {
  return foo;
};

function z(foo) {
  return foo + x;
}

var a = (x = 9, y = 10, z = 2) => {
  return x * y;
};

var b = (cb, value) => {
  return cb(value + 2);
};

console.log(y()); //
console.log(y(12)); //
console.log(y('hello')); //
console.log(foo); //
console.log(y(x)); //
console.log(z('Five')); //
console.log(z(x)); //
console.log(a(15, 2)); //
console.log(x); //
console.log(a()); //
console.log(a(41)); //
console.log(b(y, x)); //
```

## Homework

Tonight work on T-Shirts and cleaning up other past assignments.
Also, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofSnkJ9tPPM&index=4&list=PLfWvsMtBxHo1WqPrBwxq3zc2RDo5HkYwy) and a small post on https://gist.github.com.
For the file name call it `blog.md` and if you know Markdown, you can use that for fomatting.
When you're done, slack me the url of your gist after clicking on "Create Public Gist".
